						<h2>Ice Melting</h2>
						<p>
							Since the early 1900s, many glaciers around the world have been rapidly melting. Human
							activities are at the root of this phenomenon. Specifically, since the industrial
							revolution, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have raised temperatures, even
							higher in the poles, and as a result, glaciers are rapidly melting, calving off into the sea
							and retreating on land.
						</p>
						<p>
							Melting glaciers add to rising sea levels, which in turn increases coastal erosion and
							elevates storm surge as warming air and ocean temperatures create more frequent and intense
							coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons. Specifically, the Greenland and Antarctic ice
							sheets are the largest contributors of global sea level rise. Right now, the Greenland ice
							sheet is disappearing four times faster than in 2003 and already contributes 20% of current
							sea level rise.

									The rate of sea level rise is accelerating: it has more than doubled from 0.06

						<h2>Deforestation</h2>
						<p>
							Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of forested land. Throughout history and into
							modern times, forests have been razed to make space for agriculture and animal grazing, and
							to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction.
						</p>
						<p>
							Deforestation can result in more carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. That is
							because trees take in carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis, and carbon is locked
							chemically in their wood. With fewer trees around to take in the carbon dioxide, this
							greenhouse gas accumulates in the atmosphere and accelerates global warming.
						</p>
						<p>
							Deforestation also threatens the world’s biodiversity. Tropical forests are home to great
							numbers of animal and plant species. When forests are logged or burned, it can drive many of
							those species into extinction. Some scientists say we are already in the midst of a
							mass-extinction episode.

						<h2>Garbage</h2>
						<p>
							Humans generate a remarkable amount of garbage: over 2 billion tonnes per year,
							<a
								href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/what-a-waste/trends_in_solid_waste_management.html"
							>
								according to the World Bank
							</a>
							, or approximately 4.5 trillion pounds annually. And that figure is going to grow. Global
							garbage is expected to reach 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even if you could figure out where to put that much garbage, it’s going to leak dangerous
							greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change. Solid waste landfills are the
							third-largest source of methane emissions in the United States,
							<a href="https://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-information-about-landfill-gas">
								according to the most recent data available from the Environmental Protection Agency
							</a>
							.
						</p>
						<p>
							There’s a wide gap between what’s possible to be recycled and what actually is recycled. Dry
							recyclables such as plastic, paper and cardboard, metal and glass are equal to 38% of
							municipal waste, according to data in the

							>
								World Bank’s What a Waste 2.0 report

							. Meanwhile, only 13.5% of those dry recyclables are actually recycled globally.

						<h2>Air Pollution</h2>
						<p>
							Air pollution refers to the presence of foreign substances in the air that don't belong
							there, or excessive amounts of certain impurities that wouldn't harm us otherwise. When cars
							burn gasoline, they emit pollutants. Gasoline fumes escape into the air even when we pump
							gasoline into our fuel tanks.
						</p>
						<p>
							Air pollutants emitted from cars are believed to cause cancer and contribute to such
							problems as asthma, heart disease, birth defects and eye irritation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Emissions from cars increase the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the
							atmosphere. At normal levels, greenhouse gases keep some of the sun's heat in the atmosphere
							and help warm Earth. That said, many scientists believe that burning fossil fuels such as
							gasoline causes greenhouse gas levels to spike, leading to global warming.
